      <p>
        For over 30 years I have offered plants by mail-order, shipping
        hard-to-find trees and supplies to plant enthusiasts nationwide.
        Riverbend Garden’s operation is unique, propagating hundreds of rare
        Asiatic selections as well as field growing many of these hardy, hard-
        to- find gems in the farmlands of Chester NH. Most all of our rare
        plants will take winter extremes and cold hardy from USDA Hardiness
        Zones 4 to 6. When I’m not in the field or grafting trees, I’m busy in
        our pottery studio hand building and wheel throwing my popular line of
        high fired bonsai containers. Growing for bonsai and making bonsai
        pottery is my passion. We sincerely enjoy maintaining a lasting
        relationship with our customers who also have the same passion for their
        artistry; just another reason why we will only ship the finest quality,
        at the best price. I hope you’ll find that our plant selection and
        pottery will strengthen your enthusiasm to further embark on the truly
        fascinating art of bonsai. Much of our plant material is not listed and
        is available at nursery for customer pick-up. We have just added another
        greenhouse for 2021 so that we can hold over more plant material and
        expand on propagation. Our showroom also has more container selections
        and most all imported bonsai soils from Akadama & Kanuma to Lava Stone.
        If you have a special item or plant request, please write and I’ll see
        if we can ship items your way. Also, please make sure you’re on our
        newsletter mailings! We are looking forward to offering bonsai
        demonstrations & workshops at our new location in Chester, NH, so make
        sure I have your e-mail address. I thank you for every visit to our web
        page! -Wayne Jope 2021
